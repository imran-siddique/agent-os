"""
Agent-Lightning Integration for Agent OS
=========================================

Provides kernel-level safety during Agent-Lightning RL training.

Key components:
- GovernedRunner: Agent-Lightning runner with policy enforcement
- PolicyReward: Convert policy violations to RL penalties
- FlightRecorderEmitter: Export audit logs to LightningStore

Example:
    >>> from agent_os.integrations.agent_lightning import GovernedRunner, PolicyReward
    >>> from agent_os import KernelSpace
    >>> from agent_os.policies import SQLPolicy
    >>>
    >>> kernel = KernelSpace(policy=SQLPolicy())
    >>> runner = GovernedRunner(kernel)
    >>> reward_fn = PolicyReward(kernel, base_reward_fn=accuracy)
