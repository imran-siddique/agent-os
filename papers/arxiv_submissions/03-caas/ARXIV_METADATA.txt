ABSTRACT (plain text, no LaTeX, no line breaks):
Enterprise Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems suffer from context fragmentation, where relevant information is scattered across retrieval results without coherent organization. We present Context-as-a-Service (CaaS), an architecture that treats context management as a first-class system service rather than an ad-hoc retrieval step. CaaS introduces the Context Triad: Hot (immediate conversation), Warm (session-relevant retrieved chunks), and Cold (background knowledge graphs). A principled routing layer determines context placement based on recency, relevance, and retrieval cost. Evaluated on enterprise QA benchmarks, CaaS reduces hallucination rates by 34% while improving response relevance by 28% compared to standard RAG pipelines. The system handles 100K+ token contexts with sub-200ms routing latency.
