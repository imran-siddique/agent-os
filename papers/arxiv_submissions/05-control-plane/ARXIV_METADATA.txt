Agent Control Plane: A Deterministic Kernel for Zero-Violation Governance in Agentic AI

ABSTRACT (plain text, no LaTeX, no line breaks):
Current AI agent frameworks lack deterministic safety guarantees, relying on probabilistic prompt-based approaches that fail under adversarial conditions. We present the Agent Control Plane, a kernel architecture that provides POSIX-style governance primitives for autonomous agents. The system introduces three key abstractions: (1) Agent Signals (SIGSTOP, SIGKILL, SIGINT) for deterministic control flow; (2) Agent Virtual File System (VFS) for structured memory management; and (3) Kernel/User Space separation isolating policy enforcement from LLM execution. Evaluated against 60+ adversarial jailbreak attempts, the Control Plane achieves 0% policy violations compared to 26.67% for prompt-based baselines. The architecture enables enterprise deployment of autonomous agents in regulated industries including finance, healthcare, and energy.
