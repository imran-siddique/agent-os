ABSTRACT (plain text, no LaTeX, no line breaks):
Large Language Models exhibit systematic blind spots in code generation that persist across model families and prompt engineering techniques. We present the Cross-Model Verification Kernel (CMVK), an adversarial multi-model architecture that reduces blind spot occurrence from 23.7% to 8.2% through structured model disagreement. CMVK introduces three key innovations: (1) Blind Spot Detection via Cross-Entropy Divergence, where statistically significant output disagreement between models signals potential errors; (2) Adversarial Refinement Cycles, where models critique and improve each other's outputs; (3) Confidence-Weighted Aggregation that combines outputs based on per-model reliability scores. Evaluated on HumanEval, MBPP, and a novel BlindSpotBench dataset, CMVK achieves 91.2% pass rate compared to 76.8% for single-model baselines while reducing hallucinated API calls by 67%. The kernel integrates as a drop-in replacement for existing LLM code generation pipelines.
