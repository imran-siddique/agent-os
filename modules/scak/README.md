**Basic self-correction with retry for AI agents.**

SCAK provides a lightweight self-correction loop that detects agent failures and retries with corrective feedback. When an agent produces an incorrect or incomplete result, SCAK catches the failure, applies a correction strategy, and retries the action.

## Installation

```bash
pip install scak
```

## Quick Start

```python
from scak import SelfCorrectingKernel

kernel = SelfCorrectingKernel()
result = await kernel.run(task="Summarize this document", max_retries=3)
```

## Features

- Failure detection and classification
- Configurable retry strategies
- Memory of past corrections to avoid repeated mistakes
- Integration with Agent OS policy engine
