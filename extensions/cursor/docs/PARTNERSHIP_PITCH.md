# Cursor Partnership Pitch

## Email Template for Cursor Founders

**Subject:** Partnership: Agent OS + Cursor - "The AI IDE with a Safety Kernel"

---

Hi [Cursor Founder],

I'm building **Agent OS** - a safety kernel for AI agents that achieves 0% policy violations through deterministic enforcement.

Cursor is the AI-first IDE. What if it was also the **safest** AI-first IDE?

### Proposal: Native Agent OS Integration

Let's make Cursor the first IDE with Agent OS built-in.

**For Cursor:**
- 🏆 **Differentiation**: "The only AI IDE with kernel-level safety"
- 🏢 **Enterprise appeal**: SOC 2 compliant out-of-box
- 🔒 **User trust**: "Cursor won't delete your production code"

**For Agent OS:**
- 📈 Access to 500K+ developers
- 🤝 Native integration (not just an extension)
- 🚀 Joint go-to-market

### What Agent OS Does

1. **Real-time policy enforcement** - Block destructive operations before execution
2. **Multi-model verification (CMVK)** - GPT-4 + Claude + Gemini consensus reviews
3. **Complete audit trails** - Every AI suggestion logged for compliance
4. **Enterprise features** - SOC 2 mode, approval workflows, SSO

### Traction

- VS Code extension launching next month
- [X] users on waitlist
- Enterprise pilots with [Company Names]

### The Ask

Would you be open to a 30-min call to explore this?

I'd rather partner with Cursor exclusively than launch on the marketplace.

Best,
Imran

## Integration Options

### Option A: Extension (Fast - 2 weeks)
- Port existing VS Code extension to Cursor
- Available in Cursor marketplace
- **Pro**: Fast to market
- **Con**: Not differentiated

### Option B: Native Integration (Strategic - 3 months)
- Work with Cursor engineering team
- Build Agent OS into Cursor core
- **Pro**: Exclusive, deep integration, better UX
- **Con**: Requires partnership agreement

**Recommendation**: Start with Option A, pitch Option B in parallel.

## Talking Points for the Call

1. **Market Timing**
   - AI coding is mainstream (Copilot, Cursor, Claude)
   - Safety concerns are growing (enterprise adoption blockers)
   - First-mover advantage on "safe AI IDE"

2. **Technical Fit**
   - Cursor is VS Code-based (easy integration)
   - Agent OS is extension-ready
   - Can ship quickly

3. **Business Model Alignment**
   - Agent OS Pro: $9/mo (individual)
   - Agent OS Enterprise: Custom (teams)
   - Revenue share opportunity

4. **Competitive Moat**
   - GitHub Copilot has no safety layer
   - JetBrains AI has no safety layer
   - Cursor + Agent OS = unique value prop
